FUCKING BUGS
1.  CART UPDATE BEHAVIOR UPDATE (GUEST MODE) - CART IS PERFECTLY UPDATING WHEN USER IS LOGGED IN BUT IN GUEST MODE, IT ONLY UPDATES THE VERY FIRST ITEM NOT THE SELECTED ITEM

TO DO LIST:
DONE - Change the text field for event type into drop-down that only common events are shown and DONE - label events that are not common as "others.

Display the date when the customers paid for the partial payment

DONE - Hide the cancel button in the order process page if per example the status of the order is already past the "pending"

DONE - Label int the order summary, make it subtotal and the proper naming like price per pax to easily identify

VOID-Let the user choose the partial payment percentage (50% lang talaga)

DONE - Book range date, like the suer can book (2-3 days)

DONE - Policy or Rules if the customer damaged an equipment they should pay penalties
